Rio de Janeiro's Secretaria de Turismo (SETUR), the city's tourism office, expressed its support in the development of Marvella Urban Farm. The project includes the redevelopment of a 65,000 sqft area in Rio's historic port district, envisioning an urban farm producing fresh and pesticide-free vegetables directly in the city as well as an urban center promoting education, sustainability, and community development. Agro Fund One is the main project sponsor of Marvella Urban Farm and is looking forward to continuing the development.

<h4>Translation:</h4>

We are aware of your project which will be installed in the port area, where the concept of making Rio de Janeiro a city with food sovereignty will be promoted, in other words, where most of the fruits and vegetables are produced within the city limits.

In our vision, it is not intended to talk about the economic development of Rio without a strong and vehement defense to encourage tourism. It is worth noting that one of the items of the National Tourism Plan for the period 2019-2022 is the adoption of sustainable practices in the tourism sector. Therefore, given the cityâ€™s vocation, we need to follow paths to reposition ourselves as protagonists in the national and international scenario. In this scenario, the City of Rio, through its Tourism Department (SETUR) recognises that initiatives of this nature are extremely important at this time, as they generate a positive agenda for the city when people are able to travel again.

Given that, we inform you that Marvella Urban Farm will receive all our institutional support.
