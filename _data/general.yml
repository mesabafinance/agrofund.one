    Agro Fund One is an agricultural investment fund with a plan to deploy capital 
    into early growth stage companies in the agricultural sector. With emphasis on 
    diversity this fund aims to exploit the synergy of owning a vertically integrated 
    and functional farm investment portfolio, without directly owning or operating the assets. 
    This practice is commonly known as landless farming.
