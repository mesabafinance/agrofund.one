Agro Fund One is actively supporting a development in the city of Isle, Minnesota, with the goal of building an integrative urban housing and rooftop garden project. Part of the development focusses on creating a sustainable rooftop garden on an existing structure which will be used for both recreation and indoor farming. The project will likely also repurpose an adjacent commercial building to provide modern housing for local residents. Isle is a vibrant lakefront community in Mille Lacs county, Minnesota, featuring year-round recreation and activities to its visitors from around the country.
