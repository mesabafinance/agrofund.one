Actively managing an 1800 hectare farm on behalf of a Georgian institutional client since 2012. We also co-own a large specialty row crop machinery portfolio that is lease through a revenue share model on specialty crops in the region. Our work in Georgia once included the active management of one of the regionâ€™s largest bee apiary enterprises.
