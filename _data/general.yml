          Rural smallholder farmers in developing countries often lack timely information on
          market prices, agricultural techniques, and weather, and have limited access to
          traditional financial services - making it relatively difficult for them to adjust
          production, or expand operations by investing in infrastructure. However,
          according to the World Economic Forum, a market estimated to be as large as
          US$450 billion could be tapped if financial services were sufficiently extended to
          smallholders farmers.
