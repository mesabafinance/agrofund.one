  Agro Fund One is an agricultural investment fund with a plan to deploy capital 
  into early growth stage companies in the agricultural sector. With emphasis on 
  diversity this fund aims to exploit the synergy of owning a vertically integrated 
  and functional farm investment portfolio, without directly owning or operating the assets. 
  This practice is commonly known as landless farming.
