Additional members of the Minneapolis city council are now supporting the idea to develop the former Roof Depot site into a neighborhood-centric urban farm and housing project focussed on providing positive change for the East Phillips community. Agro Fund One continues to support the local community and remains highly interested in supporting residents to purchase the site and start development.
